## Installation

My hope is to create an app that could run on IoS and Android

## Usage

On your phone or tablet. I might make a desktop version, but I believe I'd start with a mobile app.

## License

This project uses the MIT license.

## Contributing

For now, it would just be me but I'd be happy to add contributors who read different genres of books than myself.

## Tests

I would test it in house till I got a working demo. Then I'd add some trusted people to look for bugs. Then maybe do a beta test for those intrested before a public relase
