## Purpose of application

The purpose of this application is to provide a quick way for any developer to make a professional looking Markdown.

## Project Workflow

The first thing I did was review our class activities that had inquirer and fs demonstrated. I wanted to see if I could figure out how to piece the code together. I was able to find some things that worked and some that didn't. I then went to Google to try and figure out how to make the parts work that weren't. I ended up trying and scrapping a lot of different pieces of code.

On day 3 of our Node.js class, our instructor demo'd a student mini porject that was very similar to this homework. This gave me some more pieces to my coding puzzle.

I had a number of issues trying to figure out how to write the README file as a string template literal. I was getting caught up in making it look good rather than making something that worked. As I worked through the code, it was nice to see things coming together. I noticed how creating links inside the Table of Contents was very similar to a previous homework assignment. Which felt great to see and draw connections to old code.

With my string template literal working, I was able to start styling it to look more professional. A member of my study group and I worked on our code together to try and figure the styling out. At his recommendation, I worked on figuring out how to use [Screencastify](https://www.screencastify.com/).

After I recorded my demo, I decided to update a few aspects of my markdown generator:

- Instead of "Your Github" I made it so that it'd say "My Github: (username)"
- I also noticed my "Resources" list was all in one line and fixed that.
