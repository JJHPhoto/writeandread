## Project Workflow

The first thing I did was review our class activities that had inquirer and fs demonstrated. I wanted to see if I could figure out how to piece the code together. I was able to find some things that worked and some that didn't. I then went to Google to try and figure out how to make the parts work that weren't. I ended up trying and scrapping a lot of different pieces of code.

On day 3 of our Node.js class, our instructor demo'd a student mini porject that was very similar to this homework. So, I found some more pieces to my coding puzzle.

I had a number of issues trying to figure out how to write the README.md file as a string template literal. I was getting caught up in making it look good rather than making something that worked. As I worked through the code, it was nice to see things coming together. I noticed how creating links inside the Table of Contents was very similar to a previous homework assignment. Which felt great to see and draw connections to old code.
